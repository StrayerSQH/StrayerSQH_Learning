0 Introduction
When Zhou Guanyu, China’s first Formula One(F1) driver, finished his race in the 2024 
Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai International Circuit as 14th on April 21, many Chinese 
media outlets, such as CCTV-5(2024), Tencent Sports(2024), and Sohu News(2024), called 
this moment a "moment in history". Mover, some Chinese media practitioners claimed that 
F1 would rise in China and then expand motor racing events’ presence in the Chinese 
market(Tan, 2024; Liu, 2024). Many non-Chinese media outlets and industry professionals
hold optimistic attitude about the future market potential of F1 in China as well. According 
to statistics by Seth Shafer and Victor Heng, F1 ranks as the third most popular sport in 
China(Shafer & Heng, 2023). A passage published on F1 Analysis points out that F1 within 
China has a bright future despite Chinese may lose interest of F1 gradually and some potential 
politics challenges(F1 Analysis, 2024). Mover, Zhou’s success even effect neighboring 
countries like Thailand according to Greg Maffei, the CEO of Liberty Media Corporation(Mao, 2024). 
But what can't be ignored is that there are only 20 seats in each season according to 
the regulations made by Federation Internationale de l'Automobile which is known as 
FIA(FIA, 2024). More badly, Zhou would leave Sauber Group at the end of this season
(Sauber Group, 2024) and Zhou’s individual financial team hasn’t sign any contract to 
keeping his seat in circuits with other teams as well. 
Despite Zhou Guanyu's inability to compete as a full-time driver in the 2025 season, Chinese 
market may not be as depressed as we think for Zhou Guanyu's effect has already made a 
significant impact on China. In this work, the definition of “Zhou Guanyu Effect” is given 
and the reasons why F1 Chinese market will still rise are given as well.  
1 Backgrounds
1.1 The popularity of short video platforms in China
Short video platforms such as TikTok (known as Douyin in China), Bilibili, and WeChat Channels 
are playing an increasingly significant role in the entertainment habits of Chinese people(CNNIC, 2024). 
According to the report published by CNNIC, the scale of short video users has reached to 1.05 
billion accounting for 95.5% of the total internet users as of June 2024.
1.2 The development of F1 in China
F1 has been developing in China for about 20 years. In 2001, the government of Shanghai 
proposes to accelerate the construction of Shanghai International Auto City(Shanghai Municipal 
Development & Reform Commission, 2001). Then, Shanghai International Circuit held China’s 
first F1 events in 2004. Between 2004 and 2019, a F1 race was held in each year. Due to the 
pandemic, the government of China announced to stop holding many large events including 
F1 events after 2020(Wang, 2022). Until 2024, F1 race returned to China again.
 Before Zhou Guanyu, the Chinese drivers who participated in F1, F2, F3, and F4 include Cheng 
Congfu, Ma Qinghua and Fang Junyu. Cheng Congfu joined and raced in F3 in 2008, so did Ma 
Qinghua. Fang Junyu had an experience that drove Sauber’s C31 in Circuit de Valencia in Spain in 2014.
